# User Research Overview

Osprey is designed for users who need to investigate and take automated action on events in real-time. By interviewing prospective Osprey users, ROOST has drafted the following user personas for developers to better understand who might be interested in using this tool. We hope this research helps the open source community prioritize features to build moving forward!

# T&S Engineers

Most engineers who are interested in potentially using Osprey are like Alice – they do not currently have a viable rules engine due to cost, lack of flexibility, or limited available options. However, they need a tool for real-time event processing as their platforms scale.

# T&S Operations Teams

T&S analysts like Bob are primarily concerned with their ability to (1) intuitively analyze data trends of adverse behavior and (2) quickly iterate on rules to take enforcement actions against such behavior.
