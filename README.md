## Overview

This repository is home to one of ROOSTâ€™s safety tools, the Osprey rules engine. Osprey is an open-source event stream decisions engine and analysis UI designed to investigate and take automatic action on events and their properties as they happen in real-time. Originally developed internally at [Discord](https://discord.com/) to combat spam, abuse, botting, and scripting across its platform, Osprey has now been open-sourced to help other platforms facing similar challenges.

Osprey is a library for processing actions through human written rules and outputting labels, webhooks back to an API and other sinks. It evaluates events using structured logic (SML), user-defined functions (UDFs), and external signals to assign labels, verdicts, and actions.

This 'Rules \+ Investigation' tool is able to:

- take action based on user behavior
- combine actions with human written rules
- let operators query human actions and past decisions
- perform investigations or write new rules based on decisions

## v0 Release Notes
The v0 release is built for engineers and Trust & Safety teams who want to explore, test, and integrate Osprey's core capabilities into their platform for incident response and Trust & Safety investigation.

Some UI features have been planned for the v1 release to ensure a solid foundation for experimentation:

- **Bulk actions** - Mass investigation and response operations through the UI
- **Labels** - Visual entity tagging and categorization systems in the interface
- **Event stream in UI** - Real-time event monitoring and alert dashboard
- **Load Balancing** - Better performance efficiency and management of sync/async rules

### Feedback Wanted
This is a working system, not a prototype. Try it locally, connect your data, write some rules, and tell us what's missing for your use case. We're particularly interested in:

- Integration challenges with your existing platform infrastructure
- Performance characteristics with your event volumes and rule complexity
- Missing detection capabilities or response actions you need
- API improvements that would make adoption easier for your team

Your experimentation feedback will directly shape v1 priorities and help us build the most useful Trust & Safety tooling for the community.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager) or python package manager of choice

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:roostorg/osprey.git
   cd osprey
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using uv:**

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Set up development tools:**

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Verify setup:**

   ```bash
   # Test linting
   uv run ruff check

   # Test formatting
   uv run ruff format --diff

   # Test pre-commit hooks
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files

5. **Start Services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```


### Development Workflow

- See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for comprehensive development setup and workflow documentation
- All code changes should pass linting (Ruff) and type checking (MyPy)
- Pre-commit hooks automatically run on each commit to maintain code quality


## Recognition
Discord uses Osprey to quickly detect and remove new types of harm that put users at risk. Rather than leaving other platforms to build similar tools from scratch, ROOST and Discord have open-sourced this powerful rule engine in collaboration with [internet.dev](https://internet.dev/) to make it available for anyone who needs it.
